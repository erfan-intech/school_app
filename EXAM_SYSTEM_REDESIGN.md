# Exam System Redesign Documentation

## Overview

The exam system has been redesigned to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to exam management. The new system separates exam creation from subject assignment, allowing for better organization and dependency management.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Structure Changes

#### New Table: `exam_subjects`
- Stores subject-specific exam details
- Contains: exam_date, start_time, end_time, teacher_id, total_marks, pass_mark, exam_status, room_number, instructions
- Links to exams table via exam_id
- Links to subjects table via subject_id
- Links to teachers table via teacher_id

#### Modified Table: `exams`
- Removed subject-specific fields (subject_id, exam_date, start_time, end_time, teacher_id, total_marks, pass_mark, exam_status, room_number)
- Added new fields: exam_name, description, exam_status (draft/published/completed/cancelled)
- Now focuses on exam-level information only

#### Updated Tables: `grades` and `exam_attendance`
- Added exam_subject_id column to link to specific exam subjects
- Maintains backward compatibility with exam_id

### 2. New Workflow

#### Step 1: Create Exam Type
- Admin creates exam types (e.g., "First Term", "Mid Term", "Final")
- Types are reusable across different classes and years

#### Step 2: Create Exam
- Admin creates an exam for a specific class-department-section combination
- Exam is created in "draft" status
- No subjects are assigned at this stage

#### Step 3: Add Subjects to Exam
- Admin adds subjects from the assigned class to the exam
- Each subject gets its own exam details (date, time, teacher, marks, etc.)
- Dependency checking ensures only valid subjects and teachers are assigned

#### Step 4: Manage Exam Subjects
- Each subject can be managed independently
- Teachers can view and manage their assigned subjects
- Students can see their exam schedule

## New API Endpoints

### Exam Management
- `GET /api/get_exams.php` - List all exams with subject counts
- `POST /api/add_exam.php` - Create new exam
- `GET /api/get_exam_details.php` - Get exam details with subjects
- `POST /api/update_exam.php` - Update exam details
- `POST /api/delete_exam.php` - Delete exam

### Exam Subject Management
- `GET /api/get_exam_subjects.php` - Get subjects for an exam
- `POST /api/add_exam_subject.php` - Add subject to exam (with dependency checking)
- `GET /api/get_exam_subject_details.php` - Get specific exam subject details
- `POST /api/update_exam_subject.php` - Update exam subject details
- `POST /api/remove_exam_subject.php` - Remove subject from exam

### Dependency Management
- `GET /api/get_available_subjects_for_exam.php` - Get available subjects for an exam
- `GET /api/get_available_teachers_for_subject.php` - Get available teachers for a subject

## New Pages

### 1. Exam Details Page (`pages/exam_details.php`)
- Shows exam-level information
- Lists all subjects added to the exam
- Allows adding new subjects
- Provides links to individual subject details

### 2. Exam Subject Details Page (`pages/exam_subject_details.php`)
- Shows details for a specific exam subject
- Displays subject-specific information (date, time, teacher, marks)
- Allows editing subject details
- Shows student grades and attendance for this subject

## Dependency Checking

The system implements comprehensive dependency checking:

### Subject Assignment
- Only subjects assigned to the class-department combination can be added
- System checks `class_dept_sub` table for valid assignments

### Teacher Assignment
- Only teachers assigned to the subject for the specific class-department can be assigned
- System checks `class_dept_sub_teacher` table for valid assignments

### Validation Rules
- Subject must be assigned to the class/department
- Teacher must be assigned to the subject for the class/department
- Exam dates must be valid
- Total marks must be greater than pass marks

## Migration Process

### 1. Database Migration
Run the SQL script: `db/exam_system_redesign.sql`

This script will:
- Create the new `exam_subjects` table
- Modify the existing `exams` table
- Update related tables (`grades`, `exam_attendance`)
- Add necessary indexes and constraints

### 2. Data Migration (if needed)
- Existing exam data can be migrated to the new structure
- A migration script can be created to move subject-specific data to `exam_subjects`

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Update all exam-related pages to work with the new structure
- Update JavaScript files to handle the new API endpoints
- Test all functionality thoroughly

## Benefits of the New System

### 1. Flexibility
- Exams can have multiple subjects with different schedules
- Each subject can have its own teacher and requirements
- Easy to add/remove subjects from exams

### 2. Scalability
- Better performance with normalized data structure
- Easier to extend with new features
- Better data integrity with proper relationships

### 3. User Experience
- Clear separation of exam and subject management
- Better dependency checking prevents errors
- More intuitive workflow for administrators

### 4. Maintainability
- Cleaner code structure
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to debug and extend

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Exam
1. Go to Exams page
2. Click "Create New Exam"
3. Fill in exam details (name, class, type, etc.)
4. Save the exam (it will be in draft status)
5. Click "View" on the exam to go to exam details
6. Click "Add Subject" to add subjects to the exam
7. For each subject, specify date, time, teacher, marks, etc.

### Managing Exam Subjects
1. Go to exam details page
2. Click "View" on any subject to see subject details
3. Edit subject details as needed
4. Manage grades and attendance for the subject

### Dependency Checking
- When adding a subject, only valid subjects for the class/department are shown
- When assigning a teacher, only teachers assigned to that subject are available
- System prevents invalid assignments automatically

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Exam Templates
- Create reusable exam templates
- Quick setup for common exam types

### 2. Bulk Operations
- Add multiple subjects at once
- Bulk grade entry
- Bulk attendance marking

### 3. Advanced Scheduling
- Conflict detection for exam schedules
- Room allocation optimization
- Teacher availability checking

### 4. Reporting
- Enhanced exam reports
- Performance analytics
- Trend analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Subject not available in dropdown**
   - Check if subject is assigned to the class/department
   - Verify `class_dept_sub` table has the assignment

2. **Teacher not available in dropdown**
   - Check if teacher is assigned to the subject for the class/department
   - Verify `class_dept_sub_teacher` table has the assignment

3. **Exam not showing subjects**
   - Check if subjects have been added to the exam
   - Verify `exam_subjects` table has records for the exam

4. **Grades not showing**
   - Check if grades are linked to `exam_subject_id`
   - Verify the relationship between grades and exam subjects

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the API endpoints to see detailed error messages and SQL queries.
